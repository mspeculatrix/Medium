# Medium

Files to support my articles on Medium.

This is a largely random collection of files to accompany articles posted to the [Machina Speculatrix publication](https://medium.com/machina-speculatrix) on Medium. (You'll need a Medium sub to read the articles.)

- Arduino - various Arduino sketches.
  - SN76489_Daisy: Playing around with the SN76489 sound chip.
- Dicom_GIFs - for [Dicom to weird animated GIF via Python](https://medium.com/machina-speculatrix/dicom-to-weird-animated-gif-via-python-4da926d48714)
- Emerald Bay - some recovered files relating to the Emerald Bay database. Includes an app I wrote to keep track of magazine articles.

There is a [separate repo](https://github.com/mspeculatrix/AVR_8bit_Basics) for the AVR microcontroller-related articles: [https://github.com/mspeculatrix/AVR_8bit_Basics](https://github.com/mspeculatrix/AVR_8bit_Basics)

And there is another repo for the [Zolatron 6502 homebrew computer](https://github.com/mspeculatrix/Zolatron64): [https://github.com/mspeculatrix/Zolatron64](https://github.com/mspeculatrix/Zolatron64)
