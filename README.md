This is a largely random collection of files to accompany articles posted to the [Machina Speculatrix publication](https://medium.com/machina-speculatrix) on Medium. (You'll need a Medium sub to read the articles.)

- Arduino - various Arduino sketches.
  - SN76489_Daisy: Playing around with the [SN76489 sound chip](https://medium.com/machina-speculatrix/fun-with-chips-sn76489-sound-generator-ic-879f836f2eda).
- Dicom_GIFs - for [Dicom to weird animated GIF via Python](https://medium.com/machina-speculatrix/dicom-to-weird-animated-gif-via-python-4da926d48714)
- [Emerald Bay](https://medium.com/machina-speculatrix/lost-software-emerald-bay-database-30d30ac475e7) - some recovered files relating to the Emerald Bay database. Includes an app I wrote to keep track of magazine articles.

I also have separate repos for specific projects:

- [Zolatron 6502 homebrew computer](https://github.com/mspeculatrix/Zolatron64)
- [AVR microcontroller-related articles](https://github.com/mspeculatrix/AVR_8bit_Basics)
- [FlashROM](https://github.com/mspeculatrix/FlashROM) - a dev board for experimenting with writing ROM code for the Zolatron to flash memory. Includes schematics, Gerbers, C++ code for the ATMEGA328PB and Python code for a PC.
- [Infrared IoT hub project](https://github.com/mspeculatrix/IR_IoT_hub) - ESP32- and ESP8266-based networked IR devices.
