This is a largely random collection of files to accompany articles posted to the [Machina Speculatrix publication](https://medium.com/machina-speculatrix) on Medium. (You'll need a Medium sub to read the articles.)

- Arduino - various Arduino sketches.
  - SN76489_Daisy: Playing around with the [SN76489 sound chip](https://medium.com/machina-speculatrix/fun-with-chips-sn76489-sound-generator-ic-879f836f2eda).
- Dicom_GIFs - for [Dicom to weird animated GIF via Python](https://medium.com/machina-speculatrix/dicom-to-weird-animated-gif-via-python-4da926d48714)
- [Emerald Bay](https://medium.com/machina-speculatrix/lost-software-emerald-bay-database-30d30ac475e7) - some recovered files relating to the Emerald Bay database. Includes an app I wrote to keep track of magazine articles.
