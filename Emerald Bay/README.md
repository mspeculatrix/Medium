# EMERALD BAY

Emerald Bay was a client/server database system written by Wayne Ratliff (the creator of dBase) and sold in the later 1980s by Migent. It was briefly touted as a dBase killer, but seems to have largely vanished into obscurity.

It used a core server engine, called Emerald Bay. This was available in two versions: a single-user program that ran locally on your PC as a TSR (Terminate and Stay Resident) program - basically sitting in the 130KB of memory; or as a network-based server that provided multi-user operations, transactional processing and other bells and whistles.

The other main part of the solution was Eagle, a front-end client that you used to write database applications.

Your applications could be distributed with the single-user Emerald Bay engine, so that they were effectively standalone.

I was given a review copy of Emerald Bay when it appeared (in 1988, if memory serves). I also visited Migent's offices in Incline Village, on the North Shore of Lake Tahoe (I was in Nevada to cover the Reno Air Races). I think I interviewed someone but can't remember if that ever resulted in an article.

To learn how the system worked, I wrote a database to store information about aviation-related magazine articles. This is in the `Mag database` directory. It still runs (I tested it in DosBox on an M1 MacBook Air).

The `PCA review.txt` file is the text of a review I wrote in 1988 for, I think, `PC Amstrad` magazine, although all traces of that magazine seem to have disappeared.
