# EMERALD BAY

Emerald Bay was a client/server database system written by Wayne Ratliff (the creator of dBase) and sold in the later 1980s by Migent. It was briefly touted as a dBase killer, but seems to have largely vanished into obscurity.

It used a core server engine, called Emerald Bay, that could be accessed locally or via a network by client applications. When used locally, it loaded as a TSR (Terminate and Stay Resident) program - basically sitting in the higher part of memory.

These applications included Eagle, which you used to write database applications.

Your applications could be distributed with an Emerald Bay runtime, so that they were effectively standalone.

I was given a review copy of Emerald Bay when it appeared (in 1988, if memory serves). I also visited Migent's offices in Incline Village, on the North Shore of Lake Tahoe (I was in Nevada to cover the Reno Air Races).

To learn how the system worked, I wrote a database to store information about aviation-related magazine articles. This is in the `Mag database` directory. It still runs (I tested it in DosBox on an M1 MacBook Air).
